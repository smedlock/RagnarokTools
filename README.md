# RagnarokTools

This is a project filled with many small programs I've written as the ideas and need for them arrived.
It has mainly been for my own use so it is not documented as well as it could be.

Everything was written here to enhance my experience in Ragnarok Online, a Korean MMO that was first
released in Korea on August 31, 2002.

I've enjoyed working on these and I intend to add more as I come across more problems that can be solved.
